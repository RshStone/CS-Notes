## Chapter 1 计算机网络和因特网

- 因特网 两种描述方式

  基本硬件和软件组件

  ​	概念：

  - ​	主机/端系统：通过因特网服务商接入因特网

  - ​	通信链路：不同物质媒介（同轴电缆、铜线、光纤、无线电频谱）具有不同传输速率-bit/s 或 bps。 发送端将数据分段，分组(packet)

  - ​	分组交换机：转发分组

  ​		两类：路由器和链路层交换机

  - ​	协议

    报文

  - ​	分布式应用提供服务的联网基础设施:

    因特网作为应用互联联系的平台:

    ​	How: 套接字接口，规定了程序交付数据的方式

- 网络边缘

  边缘路由器

  1. 家庭接入：DSL,电缆,FTTH,拨号,卫星

     DSL: 利用了本地电话基础设施 Digital Subscriber Line数字用户线 多个传输速率 12Mbps下行1.8Mbps上行

     ​	本地中心局：CO 数字用户线接入复用器（DSLAM）Access Multiplexer

     电缆：利用了有线电视基础设施 42.8Mbps下行 30.7Mbps上行

     ​	需要电缆调制解调器（cable modem）

     FTTH(Fiber To The Home):有潜力千兆比特

     ​		主动光纤网络

     ​		被动光纤网络

     卫星：1Mbps

     拨号：56kbps

  2. 企业和家庭接入：以太网和WIFI

  3. 广域无线接入：3G和LTE

- 网络核心

  1. 分组交换：不预留缓存
     - 存储转发传输
     - 排队时延和分组丢失
     -  转发表和路由选择协议
  2. 电路交换:预留缓存

- 分组交换网中的时延、丢包和吞吐量

  

- packet switching

  - mesh of interconnected routers

  - break messages into packets

  - forwarding, from one router to the next

    forwarding table 

- circuit switching

- structure of today's Internet

8. Inspect the contents of the first HTTP GET request from your browser to the server. Do you see an “IF-MODIFIED-SINCE” line in the HTTP GET?

   Answer: No.

9. Inspect the contents of the server response. Did the server explicitly return the
    contents of the file? How can you tell?

  Answer: Yes.

  `<html>

  Congratulations again!  Now you've downloaded the file lab2-2.html. <br>

  field in your browser's HTTP GET request to the server.

  </html>`

10. Now inspect the contents of the second HTTP GET request from your browser to
    the server. Do you see an “IF-MODIFIED-SINCE:” line in the HTTP GET? If
    so, what information follows the “IF-MODIFIED-SINCE:” header?

    Answer: Yes. `Thu, 06 May 2021 05:59:01 GMT`

11. What is the HTTP status code and phrase returned from the server in response to
    this second HTTP GET? Did the server explicitly return the contents of the file?
    Explain.

    Answer: The status code is `304 Not Modified`. The server did not return the contents of the file because the browser simply retrieved the contents from its cache. Had the file been modified since it was last accessed, it would have returned the contents of the file, instead it simply told my browser to retrieve the old file from its cached memory

#### 3. Retrieving Long Documents

12. How many HTTP GET request messages did your browser send? Which packet
    number in the trace contains the GET message for the Bill or Rights?

    Answer: One.

13. Which packet number in the trace contains the status code and phrase associated
    with the response to the HTTP GET request?

    Answer: Number 67.

14. What is the status code and phrase in the response?

    Answer: 200 OK.

15. How many data-containing TCP segments were needed to carry the single HTTP
    response and the text of the Bill of Rights?

    Answer:4.

#### 4. HTML Documents with Embedded Objects

![image-20210507133725228](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RshStone/CS-Notes/master/Notes/计算机网络/image-20210507133725228.png)

16. How many HTTP GET request messages did your browser send? To which
    Internet addresses were these GET requests sent?

    Answer: There are 3 HTTP GET request messages my browser send. The first GET requests was sent to 128.119.245.12. The second GET requests was sent to 128.119.245.12. The Third GET requests was sent to 178.79.137.164.

17. Can you tell whether your browser downloaded the two images serially, or
    whether they were downloaded from the two web sites in parallel? Explain.

    Answer: The two pictures are downloaded from two servers separately. Both of them are needed one TCP segment. I think they are downloaded not in parallel because when the first image is finished,  the second image is beginning.

#### 5 HTTP Authentication

18. What is the server’s response (status code and phrase) in response to the initial HTTP GET message from your browser?

    Answer: 404 Unauthorized.

19. When your browser’s sends the HTTP GET message for the second time, what new field is included in the HTTP GET message?

    Answer: Authorized field.
