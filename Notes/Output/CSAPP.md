## Preface

学编程不求甚解，对计算机体系结构越来越有好奇，同时学内容的迷茫也诱导着我对芯片的结构，计算机结构等内容有一个了解甚至是挖深。

## How this book present &your goals 

### How to think

**When you read more and write more, maybe you will feel confused. However, just reback to this and think this book how to change your mind. Does this book change your understanding on the computer or it leads you study more knowledge not only on the computer architecture but only the material science or the semiconductor structure**

Of course, learning what a system is supposed to do provides a good first step in learning how to build one, so this book also serves as a valuable introduction to those who go on to implement systems hardware and software.

### The book comparisions

1.  Many systems books are written from a builder’s perspective, describing how to implement the hardware or the systems software, including the operating system, compiler, and network interface.
   This book is written from a programmer’s perspective, describing how application programmers can use their knowledge of a system to write better programs.

2.   Most systems books also tend to focus on just one aspect of the system, for example, the hardware archi-
   tecture, the operating system, the compiler, or the network. This book spans all of these aspects, with the unifying theme of a programmer’s perspective.

   

### The author try to show you or lead you to somewhere

If you study and learn the concepts in this book, you will be on your way to becoming the rare power programmer who knows how things work and how to fix them when they break. You will be able to write programs that make better use of the capabilities provided by the operating system and systems software, that operate correctly across a wide range of operating conditions and run-time parameters, that run faster, and that avoid the flaws that make programs vulnerable to cyberattack. You will be prepared to delve deeper into advanced topics such as compilers, computer architecture, operating systems, embedded systems,networking, and cybersecurity.

### Homework to help you learn

◆Should require just a few minutes. Little or no programming required.
◆◆Might require up to 20 minutes. Often involves writing and testing some
code. (Many of these are derived from problems we have given on exams.)
◆◆◆Requires a significant effort, perhaps 1–2 hours. Generally involves writ-
ing and testing a significant amount of code.
◆◆◆◆A lab assignment, requiring up to 10 hours of effort.
