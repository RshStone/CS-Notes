### My Views about My Country

I have been worrying about this for a year.

I don’t care about the COVID-19.

But I do care about the future warfare.

Somebody is gonna drag us to the abyss of poverty and suffering.



The recent events reflect the fierce infighting before the National Congress. So, stay alert to the current affairs and analysis.



An incompetent Ming emperor ended up with suicide.

History repeats itself.

我昨天朋友圈发了一条关于股市不会涨的感想，上个星期我就让我妈把五十万撤出来了，她还有点后悔，因为第二天涨了，但是我告诉她今年不要以为中国经济会起来，我的想法来自我最近读的各种新闻，包括京东总裁换人，包括统一市场

今天股市如预期大跌

之后也不会有大势，我半个月前就转去美股

读中国历史的时候，殷海光老先生书里画了一张循环表，就是peasants-emperor的循环表

我以为我们已经跳出了循环，

但是我判断错误了，我从小一度坚信人性丑恶是最核心的社会原则，最近十几年我以为事情有变，我以为zf开始与时俱进了，但是这几年又被打脸

我很喜欢看大时代，天浴和西西里美丽传说，因为我喜欢了解人性在极端环境下会有多丑恶

我相信人性永恒，其他都是fleeting matters

永恒的人性决定了历史的走向，ideologies只是表面现象，只要时机到了，丑恶的人性就会显现

所以我大学开始，不断读文革的书，我想在某天循环开始的时候，我做好心理准备

我大学的时候最喜欢读的书，是用动物本性解释人类行为，我发现它真的说得有道理

不要把人这个动物，想的太高级



Prepare for the worst, hope for the best.



I have read lots of complaints about a leader recently. I don’t capture all the snapshots because there are too many.

Well, there are lots of overseas Chinese supporting leftists, because they don’t have to live in mainland. They don’t know the situation here and they don’t have firsthand experience.



I knew the Chinese stock market would plunge as it does today because the government is no longer concentrating on the economic development.

I invested several million RMB in the American stock market instead and it has grown up by 10% in just two weeks.

The depression is caused not by the pandemic, but Communist’s determination to return to the central planning system.

My next focus would be the study on how to deal with my money and whether to migrate or not.

Migration is not a perfect choice. My colleague had Two PRs in 2009, so I knew all the procedures of applying for Canadian PR and the drawbacks of doing so. It depends on the future situation. I don’t want to return to the era of Mao.

Those who admire him are either brainwashed fool or opportunists.



Recently, many Chinese hope the government can admit their mistake. This is naive, in my opinion. Fortunately, Russia didn’t achieve anything in the war. Otherwise, we would soon be dragged into the same abyss.

### The books I’m reading

The Book of Lord Shang ( around 390 -338 BC )

I am reading it to better understand the behavior of Chinese leaders.

“The leader should keep the commoners stupid, so as to prevent them from communicating with foreigners, hence the social stability.”

Small wonder the government closes the cram schools and tries to remove English from College Entrance Exam.



The Post-War Economic History of Japan

I am reading it to predict the future of China

The book plays down the influence of Americans on the Japanese post-war economy and attributes the success to the pre-war central planning system that has been established and later maintained by the Japanese technocrats who had a better understanding of Japanese economy than their American counterparts.



The Development of American Constitutionalism: 25 Cases that have impacts on America

I bought this book when I was in college 20 years ago. Reading American contemporary history is a way for me to understand the challenges China is facing when it’s heading for hegemony.

The book reveals the underlying principles of the vitality: the vagueness of the American Constitution allows for constant improvements through the judicial explanation of the Supreme Court.



Li Rui, the former secretary of Chairman Mao.

There are a few Chinese men of integrity and Li Rui is one of them.

Chinese from highly educated families like Li are the real idealists. I’m not looking down upon the lower class, but they tend to become opportunists disguising as Communists or nationalists.

But there is a thing that I need to clarify: I am not supportive of the “democracy” and I think iron fist is needed under certain circumstances in China.

Li Rui’s comments on Chinese leaders appalled me. LOL



The Institutional Changes on the Pension System

I have been focusing on the Western social welfare systems since college for three reasons:

1. for the graduate school studies.
2. to predict the future of China
3. I have an online friend who regarded himself as my mentor and he always reminds me of the most important life goal: to become a rich pensioner



### Why is Mao Zedong so admired in China when he killed over 200 million Chinese?

He asked me to ignore the other Chinese because they are constantly distracted by insignificant matters and focus on making myself an old rich woman. LOL

Today, a wumao admiring Mao harassed me in my comment zone, he is the kind of Chinese my friend asked me to ignore. He spends more time discussing political issues on the Internet with strangers than improving his own real life.

How sad!

None of my classmates admire Mao. He used to be a joke in my deskmates’ conversation. We don’t even call him Chairman in Sichuan.

My grandma admired him even though her dad was tortured to death in th 50s and my grandpa was tortured in the 60s.

Born in the 80s, my generation of Chinese admire money rather than any leaders.

Oh，only one classmate of mine admired Putin, but he went to Canada for phD after graduation from Qinghua. LOL, armchair politicians like him have very limited social experience.

I read Soviet Union novels but have never been a fan of Russians.

And I don’t believe in any ideologies. I only trust my own social experience.

I chat anonymously on the Internet with all kinds of Chinese to gather their firsthand social experience. In the past three months, I have talked to a guy who has just been released from the local jail, a female police working in the jail, a Chinese who owned business in Africa and went bankrupt in the pandemic.

As a kid growing up in CPC community, I reluctantly became a young pioneer but didn’t become a party members because such membership might influence my future migration.

### Why has the 996 work culture in China become scary

I used to work for three months on end in the company and work till midnight at my student’s home.

I remember asking her whether to continue or not when we were lying on sofa with eyes closed because of fatigue, she replied with “yes”, LOL.

I worked for a whole day in the school before going to her home to tutor her and her bf. What’s funny is that when her bf left, she would ask me to continue tutoring her so that she could surpass him in the academic performance. Her bf didn’t know anything about this.

And I know a guy in Beijing who teaches AP physics from 6 am till 2 am, so he works for 20 hours a day at the weekends.

He makes 1500rmb per hour so it’s worth working like a dog.

As long as the pay is satisfactory, I don’t mind working for 20 hours a day.

I don’t know why other Chinese make a fuss over 996.

Look, those who complained about 996 are unemployed now. Why not cherish the 996?
You are born in China not Switzerland, so accept the fact that life is unfair.

My plan was to work as hard as I could and retire at 35, so the only thing I could complain about was low payment.

### Is it wrong for China to insist on “Zero tolerance” strategy? Why is Shanghai so serious now?

1.I don’t think it’s serious.
2. SH is now set as an example to show other Chinese: don’t even think about it. Obey!

3. COVID is a perfect tool now. It can be used to restrict your freedom and make you poor. A rising middle class is a threat to a person who wants to keep everything under control.

4. We tried zero tolerance 50 years ago, with everyone encouraged to kill all the rats and sparrows. And now we live happily with sparrows and rats.

5. Yesterday I was reflecting on the history and came up with this conclusion: Deng Xiaoping is an EXCEPTION in our history.
6. Let’s cherish the last 50 years of freedom and prosperity, because we are losing them.

Sorry for the vagueness of my points. I’m in China now, so don’t ask me to elaborate on them. I read an article speaking my mind yesterday but I dare not cite it here.
You would be easily detained for your ““wrong” words in China, so I can’t use “right” or “wrong” to judge a political decision now.

### What are the current political issues that impact China?

The most important one is the upcoming National Congress of the Party in November, which is the root cause of many conflicts that are torturing us Chinese right now.

Not the war in Ukraine or the COVID-19. They are just scapegoats.

### What will you do after retirement?

I retired at 35.

And my recent plan is to sell the apartments, double my savings to 10 million rmb by the age of 40 through my investment in the Chinese stock market, so that I can make at least 2 million a year without having to work and can live a relatively comfortable life without a husband.

Playing a mind game with my government in the stock market is so much fun and I would love to spend more time to explore it.

I’m not that into blogging or writing a book, because such activities would pose a threat to my safety.

### What do the Chinese like about their government and their policies?

Hmmmm…I think I prefer less restrictions on the real estate market, because I am currently not allowed to buy any apartments under the policy, according to which a single family can own only one apartment.

Restriction is not a bad thing. The government is afraid of the sub-prime mortgage crisis.

And I know the government is paying a heavy price for its unduly lax policies since the financial crisis in 2008, so it’s understandable that the authority is imposing a lot of limits on loans.

I don’t think I am smarter than the thinktank of the Chinese government.

I read NY Times regularly but I think twice before making hasty and radical judgements. The Economist is much more objective in this respect, which predicted China’s future heavy reliance on domestic market and the regional transactions with the neighboring countries in 2019.

Even if Trump fails in the election this year, the next American president will continue the conflict with China. There is no doubt about it.

### Is it just me, or has China started to go crazy recently?

The only thing that went a little bit crazy was Chinese stock market, but the government has successfully suppressed the trend in July.

Financial reforms are underway steadily to cultivate a new stock market model and hence boost the technological reforms in chips and military industry.

Each time Trump announced a new plan against China, I would increase my investment in funds related to Chinese military industry. In less than a month, I made nearly 30,000 rmb out of 100,000.

My mom was too cautious. Every time the American stock market plunged, I had to spend time encouraging her to invest in Chinese stock market. The night I heard Americans buying missiles from Israel, I told my mom to buy Chinese military stocks ASAP, and she thanks me for this suggestion.

Oh, there was another crazy thing this year—the Shenzhen real estate market, which has been put under control now. I should have sold my apartment before the government took action. Anyway, I sold one in July, and I got two more for sale,so I can have more cash for the Chinese stocks.

True, we are busy making money this year.

I am honing my stock market skills every day. That's the only thing I’m crazy about.

### Do you think China is a terrible country? (I am a Chinese)

I think it is pointless to argue with the Europeans. I didn’t do that when I was chatting in Yahoo rooms 20 years. Basically, I ignored all the Europeans, and left some Americans and Chinese on my list to talk to.

Some Americans, if not all, are worth spending time on. At least they are open-minded.

and HUMOROUS, like the Vietnam War veteran that I used to talk to.

I think I have learned a lot from talking to the Americans, in ways to entertain others.(sometimes offend my own fellows if he is too dumb)

Britons, Europeans, well, I really got no interest in persuading them.

I’d better spend that valuable time on my favorite horror movies.

Typical conversation between me and random Europeans:

He: where from

me:sichuan

he:where is that

(no more coversation, I ignore them at this point. I got no time for people who do not read as extensively as I do)

conversation with American

he: where from

me: sichuan

he:great food, pretty girls(this is obviously info. from his Chinese colleagues in Silicon Valley)

One American guy even asked me whether I am from mianyang or zizhong, two third-tier cities. LMAO

Americans love to explore the world, and this is their great strength.

### The US is planning to cancel the visa of Chinese graduate students. Will it be a huge blow to study exchange programs?

A huge blow to American universities, which are going bankrupt.

Many American universities are beginning to lower their admission standards, which will further reduce the value of overseas qualification in China.

### Why do most Chinese people not want to discuss politics?

We have nickname for Mao in Sichuan.

And my primary school classmates discussed his affair in the classroom, but, mind you, that happened because we are civil cervant kids born in the 80s. Most of our peers don’t know about those gossips.

We derive the skepticism from our parents who underwent Cultural Revolution. But that’s the case with kids born in the 80s, not those born afterwards.

Discussion mostly take place at intellectuals’ home, including communists.

China, as a matter of fact, has never been Confucian.

I recently recommended a Harvard scholar’s “the Art of the Governed” to my followers at zhihu, which can tell you how Chinese disobey the orders and create their own system.

### Mainland Chinese are everywhere, because they are rich. Where is their money coming from? If the average salary in China is £200 to £500 a month, how do they afford children to study abroad?

The average salary is around 1500 dollars a month in my city.

A vendor like my mom’s classmate can earn 1600 dollars per month, selling snacks in the community.

A xinjiang guy told me he made 140 dollars per night, selling BBQ outside hotels.

It's easy to make money in my country nowadays. After all, we have the largest consumer market in the world.

Some mainland housewives in HK make 3500 dollars a month by simply shooting daily life Vlogs for bytedance.

Studying in Europe and Japan is not expensive, compared with UK and US.

That's why I told you guys Chinese in Germany and Japan are not the smartest and richest.

It's EASY to be admitted by European and Japanese top universities, frankly speaking.(Japanese schools like Tokyo University recruit students with a TOEFL score of around 80. That's a super low level.)

So, degrees from those places are not very competitive in mainland job market.

Qualification from overseas will continue to lose its value in mainland.

That's why I don't pursue degrees overseas now. I would rather invest my money in the stock market.

The high school teacher living next door makes 100 ,000 dollars a year by working full time and part time.

Coders work for BAT or unicorns in mainland can make around 5000 to 13,000 dollars a month.

I have earned 20,000 dollars this year from my investment in the fund, thanks to the government’s support of the stock market. Basically, I have 15% return of close to 30,000 dollars each year from such investment. (my investment in semiconductor and new energy has plummeted, but it never bothers me. The government will spare no efforts to support technology in the subsequent months.)

Many Chinese students have no idea how the Chinese society runs, just like you guys.
