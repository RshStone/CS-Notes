- aim

  use the Spring portfolio to build a RESTful service while leveraging the stackless features of REST.

- REST: the de-facto standard for building web services on the web

    - Pros: easy to build and easy to consume.

    - Why REST?

      embraces the precepts of the web, including its architecture, benefits, and everything else

    - By building on top of HTTP, REST APIs provide the means to build:

        - Backwards compatible APIs
        - Evolvable APIs
        - Scaleable services
        - Securable services
        - A spectrum of stateless to stateful services
